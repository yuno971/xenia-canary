### Disclaimer

The goal of this project is to experiment, research, and educate on the topic
of emulation of modern devices and operating systems. **It is not for enabling
illegal activity**. All information is obtained via reverse engineering of
legally purchased devices and games and information made public on the internet
(you'd be surprised what's indexed on Google...).
